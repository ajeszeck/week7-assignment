# Week 7 Assignment

## The name of your project
Dreamly (*Name may change*) Dream Journal

## Elevator Pitch
This site can be used to track your dreams, you can record your moods on going to sleep and waking up, and then view charts to see patterns and trends. I would like to also incorporate a Natural Language sentiment analysis API to automatically assess the basic feel of the dreams and hopefully provide better charts/graphs using that info.
